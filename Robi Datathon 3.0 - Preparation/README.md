## For Learning To do
1. Python Language
2. Jupyter Notebook/ Lab
3. Package Installation using pip
4. Numpy
5. Pandas - Data load, missing value fill, group by, correlation study, query
6. Matplotlib
7. Seaborn
8. A few machine learning techniques, model
9. Time series analysis, predictive analysis, anova analysis, etc.

## Summary of the Meeting
* The most important part of the datathon is understanding the data. A file will be given to you and you have find the insight of the data. To my understanding, those who are good in DB Design (ERD), Reduction to schema, reverse engineering from the dataset to find the logical structure of the data will be able to do good for this.

* The second point is analytics of the data using Python libraries. Here the challenge is time management to find the solution in the shortest possible time.

* The third part is the appropriate data visualization. You can use any visualization tool.

* The fourth and most important part is the novelty of your solution to solve the real life problems and develop applications.
